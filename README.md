## Joshua Holloway (undergoing maintenance)

I'm a **full stack developer** who's recently finished Makers and is looking for a **front end ReactJS role**.

My interest in coding began when I shadowed developers at a startup. I questioned
the thought processes that underpinned the planning and implementation of features. Through this,
I quickly grasped the core principles of programming. One of my first understandings was the single
responsibility principle and with this I started to put forward ideas on code structure and method functionality.

I loved that coding is a language of creation and problem solving and I was eager to not just passively learn. 
To that end, I sat down at my laptop and greeted the world. It was great. I wanted to write, learn and understand
code so I continued to create small side projects while taking on more responsibilities at the startup. It quickly became
apparent to me that I needed to make this passion a full time job. Furthermore, I wanted to learn practices
such as TDD, SOLID, XP values and pair programming in a structured setting. Hence, I joined Makers Academy! I'd love
to work in a supportive environment where these principles are followed.
