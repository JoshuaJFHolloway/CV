## Joshua Holloway

I'm a **full stack developer** who's recently finished Makers and is looking for a **front end ReactJS role**.

My interest in coding began when I shadowed developers at a startup. I questioned
the thought processes that underpinned the planning and implementation of features. Through this,
I quickly grasped the core principles of programming. One of my first understandings was the single
responsibility principle and I started to put forward ideas on code structure and method functionality.
I loved that coding is a language of creation and problem solving and I was eager to not just passively learn. 
To that end, I sat down at my laptop and greeted the world. It was great. I wanted to write, learn and understand
code so I continued to create small side projects while taking on more responsibilities at the startup. 

My passion and curiosity for coding rapidly took over my life and I knew that I wanted to work on it full time.
Ever since then I have continued to grow and create projects, some of which you can see below.

I love the component.


(And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment)
