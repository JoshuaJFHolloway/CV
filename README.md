## Joshua Holloway

I'm a full stack Javascript/Ruby developer looking for a front end ReactJS role.

After graduating with a MSc in Environmental Strategy I started working for local 
government. However, I quickly grew disillusioned with my opportunities in the
environmental sector and decided to research programming. Coding grabbed my attention
like nothing else could and I loved its logicality. Hence, soon after, I packed in my 
job and joined Makers so I could make this newly found passion a full time job.

(And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment)

## Skills

**Frameworks**: Javascript, ReactJS, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS (styled-components for ReactJS too), jQuery, PostgreSQL.

**Testing frameworks**: Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme, Rspec, Capybara.
