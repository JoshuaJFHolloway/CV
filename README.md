I'm a **full stack developer** who's recently finished Makers and is looking for a **front end ReactJS role**.

My interest in coding began when I shadowed developers at a startup. I questioned
the thought processes that underpinned the planning and implementation of features. Through this,
I quickly grasped the core principles of programming. One of my first understandings was the single
responsibility principle and with this I started to put forward ideas on code structure and method functionality.

I loved that coding is a language of creation and problem solving and I was eager to not just passively learn. 
To that end, I sat down at my laptop and greeted the world. It was great. I wanted to write, learn and understand
code so I continued to create small side projects while taking on more responsibilities at the startup. It quickly became
apparent to me that I needed to make this passion a full time job. Furthermore, I wanted to learn practices
such as TDD, SOLID, XP values and pair programming in a structured setting. Hence, I joined Makers Academy! I'd love
to work in a supportive environment where these principles are followed.

**Testing frameworks**: Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme, Rspec, Capybara, Nightwatch.js, (Cypress)



#### Excellent communicator

During my time at Mole Valley District Council I regularly spoke with the general public. Part of my
job was to explain council policy and legislation in simple terms. Hence, I learnt how to effectively
communicate technical language to those who are not familiar with it. I was able to carry this skill into 
Makers and pair programming helped me refine it further. It is so important to be able to articulate thoughts 
and processes so that your partner can know what you are implementing. Otherwise, they are not in a position
to contribute or even give helpful tips.


#### Working under pressure

During my MSc I met regular deadlines for projects and research and this prepared me well for the 
weekend challenges and group projects at Makers. It is a calm disposition and my strong time management
and organisational skills that have allowed to do this.


#### Fast learner

For our WellMo project, I learnt ReactJS, Jest, Enzyme and Nightwatch.js without them being taught on the course
and, following TDD, built and tested a functioning CBT thought recording app. Furthermore, I decided to complete
one the Makers practise tech tests in React (Tic Tac Toe) so that I could further my knowledge of the tech.
I am curious about absolutely everything and always looking for opportunities to learn. This is why
