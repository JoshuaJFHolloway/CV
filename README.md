## Joshua Holloway

I'm a full stack developer who's recently finished Makers and is looking for a front end ReactJS role.

My interest in coding began when I shadowed developers at a startup. I would question 
the thought processes that underpinned the planning and implementation of features. This allowed
me to quickly grasp what programming is all about. Once I knew this, I started to put forward
ideas on code structure and method functionality. I loved that coding is a language of 
creation and problem solving and I was eager to play with it. It was at this point that 
I sat down at my laptop and greeted the world. It was great. I wanted to do, learn and
know more so I continued to create small side projects while contributing at the startup.
My passion and curiosity for coding rapidly took over my life and I knew that I wanted to work on it
full time. Hence, I handed in my notice at the local council I was working at and took my test
to join Makers Academy.


(And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment)
